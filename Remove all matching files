Removes all matching files in the current directory and all subdirectories.

grep -lrIZ <regex> | xargs -0 rm -f --


-l  : prints names of files matching search pattern.
-r  : recursive search in current directory.
-I  : skip binary files.
-Z  : ensures file names are null terminated (stops issues with white space in file name).
<regex>   : matching the filenames to be deleted.
xargs -0  : feeds the file names from grep to "rm -f", using NULL bytes as a separator.
--  : marks the end of options and allows for removal of file names that begin with "-".
